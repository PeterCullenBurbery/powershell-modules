Version 1.8.0: Updated release notes. PowershellFunctions@https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowershellFunctions/ is no longer actively maintained. Moving on torward PowershellFunctions005@https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowershellFunctions005/ and PowershellFunctions007@https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowershellFunctions007/.

Version 1.7.3: Removed C# components. StartProcessLongFilePath was not working so I removed it.

Version 1.7.2: Update release notes.

Version 1.7.1: Removed Start-ProcessLongFilePath from the module. The DLL-based cmdlet was deemed too complex.

Version 1.7.0: Added Start-ProcessLongFilePath, a wrapper for a C#-based cmdlet that launches processes using paths exceeding Windows MAX_PATH limitations. Useful for deeply nested folders or long file names. Includes support for optional arguments.

Version 1.6.0: Added Enable-LongFilePaths to programmatically enable support for file paths longer than 260 characters. The function checks the current registry value and only modifies it if necessary.

Version 1.5.0: Add-ToPath and Remove-FromPath now automatically call `refreshenv` if available, updating the current session immediately after modifying the system PATH.

Version 1.4.0: Added Get-PowershellPath to display the PATH environment variable in a zero-padded, indexed table. Uses Format-Table for clear formatting and supports inspection of system path entries.

Version 1.3.0: Added Add-DefenderExclusion to exclude folders from Microsoft Defender. Automatically excludes the parent folder if a file is specified. Requires administrator privileges.

Version 1.2.0: Fixed Add-ToPath and Remove-FromPath to correctly resolve relative paths (e.g., ".") using Resolve-Path. Improves reliability when modifying system PATH from any location.

Version 1.1.0: Added Bring-BackTheRightClickMenu and Use-Windows11RightClickMenu to toggle classic and default context menus in Windows 11. Improved tagging and documentation.

Initial release: includes time zone resolution, ISO week and ordinal date formatting, File Explorer restart, and PowerShell version capability detection.
